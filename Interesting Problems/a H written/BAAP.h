get clarity between sum tree, child sum nd shit
get clarity trace this : Given a number K, we have to remove (prune the tree) nodes from the tree which lie on a path having sum less than K. A node can be part of multiple paths. So we have to delete it only in case when all paths from it have sum less than K.
n1 pairs of “{} ” brackets

Explain about the garbage collection? If you want to implement the garbage collection in any of your preferred language, how do you code the manual garbage collection function.  
1. Quicksort (everything) , Implement it iteratively ;) #GfG

___________________________________________________
1. Given 2 linked lists representing two large nos, find the sum of those.
2. Reverse lists 1 and 2
3. Sum element-by-element (while maintaining a carry), putting the results in a list 3 that you construct from tail to head
4. Convert lists 1 and 2 to ints (e.g. int list1AsInt = 0; For each node {list1AsInt *= 10; list1AsInt += valueOfThisNode;} )
	Sum those ints
	Convert the result to a linked list (e.g. valueOfBrandNewNode = list3AsInt % 10; list3AsInt /= 10; Add a new node that points to the prev one; )
5. Traverse both lists once to find out their lengths. For this example, let's assume that list 1 is longer by N nodes.
6. Create a list 3 to represent the sum without carries and a list 4 to represent the carries.
7. For the first N nodes of list 1, copy those values to list 3 and make list 4's values be 0.
8. For the remaining nodes of lists 1 and 2, sum element-by-element, putting the sum mod 10 in list 3 and the carry in list 4. Keep track via a bool of whether list 4 is all 0's.
9. Add a last node with value 0 to list 4.
10. If list 4 is entirely 0's, done. Else, re-curse to step 2, treating list 3 as the new list 1 and list 4 as the new list 2. We know the length of the new list 1 is the larger of the lengths of the old lists 1 and 2, and the length of the new list 2 is one more than that.
11. Design a stack with push, pop, find middle element in O(1). (hint: use doubly linked list to create STACK)

13. BST to DLL (An apple a day) or at LeetCode "Convert Binary Search Tree (BST) to Sorted Doubly-Linked List"
14. Using Heap, find the first K largest/smallest nos in an Array !

Q3: Find your own method to balance an unbalanced binary tree.
(you must not use existing methods like AVL, red black or b trees).
Hint: There is no restriction on placing nodes. You can remove any
node from any place and put it in any place.
I devised an algorithm which will make use of two lists. One list
contains nodes far away from the root and this is sorted in decreasing 
order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level. Other 
list contains nodes which are not fully filled. This is sorted 
increasing order of levels and left to right if nodes are in same level .
Remove the first node (listed in list1) and insert as a child of
first node in list2.add this node also in list 2. Do this operation 
until the height of the tree becomes log(n). Interviewer was 
impressed with this and finished the interview.

1. There is a big file of words which is dynamically changing. We are continuously adding some words into it. How would you keep track of top 10 trending words at each moment?
2. Find the longest increasing subsequence in O(nlogn). Proof and full code was required.

3. You are given a linked list and an integer k. Reverse every consecutive k nodes of the given linked list.
	[CODE IT later]
4. You are given pairs of numbers. In a pair the first number is smaller with respect to the second number. Suppose you have two sets (a, b) and (c, d), the second set can follow the first set if b<c.So you can form a long chain in the similar fashion. Find the longest chain which can be formed.

6. How to implement a stack which will support following operations in O(1) time complexity?
	1) push() which adds an element to the top of stack.
	2) pop() which removes an element from top of stack.
	3) findMiddle() which will return middle element of the stack.
	4) deleteMiddle() which will delete the middle element.
	Push and pop are standard stack operations.

	that fits there and doesn't violate the sudoku rules
