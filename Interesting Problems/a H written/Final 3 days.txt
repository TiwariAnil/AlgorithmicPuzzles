mergesort linked list


JUST Write it
Median in a stream of integers (running integers)
Median in a stream of integers (running integers)
Median in a stream of integers (running integers)
Median in a stream of integers (running integers)


Write a program to find longest repeating substring In a given 
string running code were required covering all base cases.

Few question related to OS what is deadlock, Race-condition, Semaphore and many more, 
few question Related to 
DBMS what is Normalization define all 
normal forms(I directly told him I don’t remember I read it in 5th semester )

convert a decimal number into binary your code should work
 on both big endian and small endian machine.
