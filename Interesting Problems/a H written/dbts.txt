 To find if there is any root to leaf path with specified sum in a binary tree
 
  Given a linked list containing character in each node, segregate its nodes in such a way that all nodes 
  containing a vowel are moved to the end of the linked list. We will have to maintain the order.

   Given a linked list, sort without extra space.
   
   Methods to serialize & deserialize a tree ,must complete the below 2 monthods. File serialize (node *root) & node * deserialize(File f)
   
   
   Q1: Calculate the expression (2+3)*5 .. The question just said this .. I guess we had to make our own assumptions to solve the problem

Q2: Two trees can be called isomorphic if they have similar structure and the only difference amongst them can be is, that their child nodes may or may not be swaped..

for example

——4

—-2—6

–1–3–5–7

and

——4

—-6—2

–1–3–7–5

are isomorphic .. the trees are similar and a few nodes have their left and right child swapped…

Given two trees determine if they are isomorphic…

The interviewstreet people marked the solution to my first question wrong even when it worked fine.. When I told the HR about the situation, she got it checked with some of the amazon guys and they were ok with it.

I cleared the written test.


Find k-th smallest element in BST (Order Statistics in BST)

Dynamic Programming | Set 3 (Longest Increasing Subsequence)



Online Programming Round: (5 methods, 2 hours)

1)     A sentence is given which contains lowercase English letters and spaces. It may contain multiple spaces. Get first letter of every word and return the result as a string. The result should not contain any space. Complete the following method:

static String getFirstLetterWord(String text) {  }

2)     Given an array. Iterate it for the given number of times. And then return the summation of the resultant elements.

Ex: Array is { 1,2,5,6}, N=2

After 1st iteration: {2-1, 5-2, 6-5}={1,3,1}

After 2nd : {3-1, 1-3}={2,-2}

Sum is 2  + (-2) = 0

If only one element remains in the array, the element remains the same after applying the iteration. Complete the method.

static int iterateSequence(Vector<Integer> a, int N) { }

3)     Find Nth largest element in the BST. Complete the method.

staticintnLargeBST(Node root, int N) {}

Given that

class Node
{
    Node left, right;
    int data;
    Node(intnewData)
    {
        left = right = null;
        data = newData;
    }
}
4)     Swap adjacent nodes in the linked list. Change the links, not the data. Complete the method.

Ex:1, 2, 3, 4

o/P: 2, 1, 4, 3

ex: 1,2,3,4,5

op: 2, 1, 4, 3, 5

class Node {
  Node next;
  int val;
}

static Node swapAdjacentNodes(Node head) {} 
5)     Find length of the Longest-Increasing-Subsequence.

e.g.1.
i/p: 1, 2, 3
o/p: 3
explanation: the sequence is increasing

e.g.2
i/p: 4,5,6,7,8,1,2,1,2,3,5,4,6,7,8,9,0,6,7
o/p: 8
xp: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9

e.g.3
i/p: 1,2,9,4,5,10,7,8
o/p: 6
xp: 1,2,4,5,7,8

e.g.4
i/p: 20, 3,22, 5,50, 34, 49, 91,110
o/p:6
xp: 20,22,34,49,91,110
OR
3,5,34,49,91,110

Complete the method.

static int lengthLIS(Vector<Integer> sequence) {}

=============================================Amazon Interview Doubts========================================
=============================================MS Interview Doubts============================================
1. Given an unsorted array, how to divide them into two equal arrays whose difference of sum is minimum
2.Given a string, you have remove duplicates from it in O(n) time and O(1) space.
3. mapping nd hashing.
4.  Traverse a binary tree in a Zig-Zag order. (Book Narshimaa).
5. Print the last ten lines. If number of lines is less than 10 then print all lines.
6.  find consecutive elements in array that have sum equals to zero.
7. How will I keep track of number of visitors visited my web page?
8.Given a string. Find a character with most number of occurrences. O(n) and in space, without using hashing..
9.We have a ‘n’ steps and a ball which take either 1 step at a time or 2 steps at a time. Find out the number of possible ways it covers exactly ‘n’ steps. (Complexity !! )
10. one's and two's complement, its necessary !


1. WAP to print last 10 lines of given string. If string has less than 10 lines then print whole string, lines are separated by ‘\n’ . [Ans. There are two app. (i) Top to down (ii) Bottom to up ( this is efficient ) ]
2.5. Convert Singly and Doubly sorted linked list to BST and optimize it.
 (Chotu's book :D )
3. Trie !
4. Suppose you are going to organize a party from 9:00 am to 20:00 pm. You have invited ‘n’ number of guests for the party. You are given the arrival time and the departure time of all guests. Every time a new guest arrives, you give him a glass of wine and when he leaves, you take the glass back. If someone has left and returned the glass, you can give the same glass to a new guest who has just arrived.
Based on the given schedule for guests, determine the minimum number of glasses required for the party. A guest can come or leave at any time, but you are given the fixed schedule. Write code for the given problem.


0.  How can we do a Tree Traversal without using a stack (not even the stack for recursion). Write code for an in-order traversal without using stack. What would be the changes in the function if we want to do a pre-order or post-order traversal?
1. how is the complexity of BFS is O(V+E). 
2. Print paths also for a Graph between two points (DFS or BFS or Both)
3. Diff between List and Vector ;) in C++.
4. Reverse using 3 pointers and 2 pointers.
5. least common ancestor of two given nodes in a binary tree. ( both recursive and iterative approach).
http://leetcode.com/2011/07/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-part-ii.html
6. Which data-structure you will use for implementing the ‘malloc’ and ‘free’ functions? (You have been given with a pointer which points to a large chunk of memory).Write full codes for implementing these two functions.
7. Implement T9 dictionary. how T9 works is : let say if I press 223 it should give all the possible valid words in suggestion 

1.Two numbers are stored in link list, need to add those two number.I was also asked to write the test case which breaks the code.
2.How does the telephone directory search of nokia phone works. If i give a name it should get me the contact number and vice versa.
3.Given an array which contains a number in majority (i.e. A number occurs more than 50% times in the array) need to find it.
4.Given an array of size n, having numbers from 1..n , with one number missing and one occurring twice. Find the 2 numbers
5.Code to remove alternate duplicate characters from given string.

============================================================================================================
1) You have given a number N, print all balanced parenthesis expression which 
can be generate using N pairs of open and close braces. 
For ex. for N=3, ((())),()()(),()(()),(())()
First i gave him a brute force solution(generate all possible combination and check for valid expression),then he ask me for optimized code and I was able to do it after little mess-up.also ask for complexity of my code.

1) A number is given say n, 
find the minimum number which is greater than n and has same no. of set bits in it.

Resize() malloc()
string multipication()

g++ -save-temps code.cpp
-> to get .o, .i , .s ie object, preprocessed, assembly files respectively :D

Quora: What is most useful shortcut key on browser !	
	
Hexa decimal, convert it into binary or decimal
