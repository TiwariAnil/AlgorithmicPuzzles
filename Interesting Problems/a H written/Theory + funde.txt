a): Diameter of tree ! 						#both uses same property of finding height while recursing !

87. Max no of knights can be placed on nxn chess board.
Ans: ceil(n*n/2) i.e all white cells / black cells

88. Reservoir Sampling approach

89.What is an interface? Why it is used? Give an example. 
What is an abstract class? Why it is used? Give example. Why 2 different concepts of interface and abstract class?

90.  Do you know about singleton class? What is it? 
Implement a simple singleton class. I made some mistakes in making attributes static etc. He guided me and finally I corrected all bugs.

91. What is priority queue? and what about 3 way of implementation , sorted , unsorted and binary tree??
92. Direct implement from stl lib??

93. If vectors are copied as whole new ?
map , set, vector , multiset ===   complexity, storage+time ; everyother thing!

94. typedef vs #define
The #define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases 
for various data types similar to typedef but with three differences:

The typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to "types" only where as 
#define can be used to define alias for values as well, like you can define 1 as ONE etc.

The typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler where as #define
 statements are processed by the pre-processor.

95. ===============COMPLETE | STRICT | FULL > BINARY TREE=================================================================

COMPLETE B.T = Every level except last should be filled completely
Is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last,
is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
it seems to mean a balanced tree.

       x        COMPLETE (except last level, above every node is filled)

    /     \
   x       x

/ \ /
x x x

FULL B.T ------ All nodes other than leaves have must 2 children.
(sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree or strictly binary tree)
is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
so you have no leaves with only 1 child. Appears to be the same as strict binary tree.

       x        FULL (ever node has 2 children)

96. ================LONGEST PATH IN ANY TREE================================================================
There is this standard algorithm for finding longest path in undirected
trees using two depth-first searches:

1: Start DFS from a random vertex v and find the farthest vertex from it; 
   say it is v'.
2: Now start a DFS from v' to find the vertex farthest from it. 
   This path is the longest path in the graph.

97. ================ORDER OF BFS AND DFS===============================================================
Analysis of BFS O(V+E)(see the image , or cormem page 597)
My Conclusion: Since we get each vertex once, as visit[] is false initially and 
we do it visit[i]=true once we visit any vertex. So, each vertex one time. Plus to
get on other vertex, we check each edge connected to the vertex that we reached.
So, we cover every edge "at least" once. Hence O(V+E).

Similarly, DFS also.
